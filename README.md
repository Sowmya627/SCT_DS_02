# SCT_DS_02
Dataset: Titanic (Kaggle)
Task: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore variable relationships and identify patterns.

# ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations & Analysis

The project includes multiple steps and plots for EDA:

# 1. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked).

Convert categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into usable formats.

Remove/transform outliers where needed.

# 2. Univariate Analysis

Distribution plots for age, fare, and categorical variables (Sex, Pclass, Embarked).

Bar charts for survival counts.

# 3. Bivariate Analysis

Survival rate by gender, passenger class, and embarkation point.

Correlation heatmap of numerical features.

# 4. (Optional Extension)

Feature engineering (e.g., family size).

Build simple predictive models for survival.

# ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas â€“ for data manipulation & cleaning

matplotlib / seaborn â€“ for visualizations

numpy â€“ numerical operations

# ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.

2. Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

3. Run the script:
